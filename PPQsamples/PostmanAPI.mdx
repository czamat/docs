This document provides a concise guide for configuring Postman to integrate with the [ppq.ai](http://ppq.ai) `chat/completions` endpoint. It includes setup instructions, example payloads, and troubleshooting guidance for common errors.

## What Is Postman?

Postman is a desktop and web-based tool used for testing, exploring, and automating API requests. It lets you easily send HTTP requests, view responses, manage authentication, organize collections, and debug APIs without writing code. It’s widely used by developers for building, documenting, and validating APIs.

## Requirements

- A valid [ppq.ai](http://ppq.ai) API key
- Postman installed
- Endpoint: `https://api.ppq.ai/chat/completions`

## Configuring Postman

### Authentication Setup

1. Open a new POST request in Postman.
2. Enter the URL: `https://api.ppq.ai/chat/completions`
3. Go to the **Auth** tab.
4. Set **Auth Type** to **Bearer Token**.
5. Paste your API key into the **Token** field.
6. Ensure you do _not_ type `Bearer` manually; Postman adds it automatically.

### Request Body

1. Open the **Body** tab.
2. Select **raw**.
3. Select **JSON** from the dropdown.
4. Enter a valid JSON payload such as:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5.1",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello!"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Errors and How to Fix Them

### 401 Unauthorized

**Message:** `Missing or invalid Authorization header`

**Causes:**

- Auth type not set to Bearer Token
- Token field contains incorrect formatting
- Authorization appended in the URL instead of the header

**Fix:**

- Use **Auth Type: Bearer Token**
- Paste only the API key (no prefix)
- Verify Headers show exactly: `Authorization: Bearer <your key>`

### 400 Bad Request

**Message:** `Invalid JSON in request body`

**Causes:**

- JSON syntax errors
- Non‑standard quotes
- Missing commas or braces
- Incorrect Body type

**Fix:**

- Ensure Body is set to **raw → JSON**
- Validate the JSON structure
- Use straight quotes `"` only

## Successful Response

Once authentication and JSON formatting are correct, the endpoint returns: `200 OK`

This indicates that the request was processed successfully and your Postman integration with [ppq.ai](http://ppq.ai) is functioning properly.
